    # to avoid the error "Values larger than 1/3 of a buffer page cannot be indexed."
    # due to the fact that large text column cannot be indexed by btree indexes
    # we are going to need to build an index on the hash of the `body_markdown` column.
    # We also cannot use a `HASH` index as it's not supported by unique columns.
    # I don't recommend using GiN or GiST as well
