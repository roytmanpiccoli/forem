    # @api private
    #
    # This is an experimental object that we're refining to be a
    # competitor to the existing feed strategies.
    #
    # It works to implement conceptual parity with two methods of
    # Articles::Feeds::LargeForemExperimental:
    #
    # - #default_home_feed
    # - #more_comments_minimal_weight_randomized
    #
    # What do we mean by "conceptual parity"?  Those two methods are
    # used in the two feeds controllers: StoriesController and
    # Stories::FeedsController.  And while they use some of the
    # internal tooling there's some notable subtle differences.
    #
    # Where this class differs is that it is aiming to build the feed
    # based from the given user's perspective.  Whereas the other Feed
    # algorithm starts with a list of candidates that are global to
    # the given Forem (e.g., starting the base query from the
    # `articles.score`, a volatile and swingy value that favors global
    # reactions over user desired content).
    #
    # This is not quite a chronological only feed but could be easily
    # modified to favor that.
    #
    # @note One possible short-coming is that the query does not
    #       account for the Forem's administrators.
    # @note For those considering extending this, be very mindful of
    #       SQL injection.
    class WeightedQueryStrategy
      # This constant defines the allowable relevance scoring methods.
      #
      # A scoring method should be a SQL fragment that produces a
      # value between 0 and 1.  The closer the value is to 1, the more
      # relevant the article is for the given user.  Note: the values
      # are multiplicative.  Make sure to consider if you want a 0
      # multiplier for your score.  Aspirationally, you may want to
      # think of the relevance_score as the range (0,1].  That is
      # greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
      #
      # In addition, as part of initialization, the caller can
      # configure each of the scoring methods :cases and :fallback.
      #
      # Each scoring method has the following keys:
      #
      # - clause: [Required] The SQL clause statement; note: there
      #           exists a coupling between the clause and the SQL
      #           fragments that join the various tables.  Also, under
      #           no circumstances should you allow any user value for
      #           this, as it is not something we can sanitize.
      #
      # - cases: [Required] An Array of Arrays, the first value is
      #          what matches the clause, the second value is the
      #          multiplicative factor.
      #
      # - fallback: [Required] When no case is matched use this
      #             factor.
      #
      # - requires_user: [Required] Does this scoring method require a
      #                  given user.  If not, don't use it if we don't
      #                  have a nil user.
      #
      # - group_by: [Optional] An SQL fragment that ensures a valid
      #             postgres statement in older versions of postgres.
      #             See
      #             https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/15240#discussion_r750392321
      #             for further sleuthing details.  When you reference
      #             a field in the clause, you likely need to include
      #             a corresponding :group_by attribute.
      #
      # - joins: [Optional] An SQL fragment that defines the join
      #          necessary to fulfill the clause of the scoring
      #          method.
      #
      # - enabled: [Optional] When false, we won't include this.  By
      #            default a scoring method is enabled.
      #
      # @note The group by clause appears necessary for postgres
      #       versions and Heroku configurations of current (as of
      #       <2021-11-16 Tue>) DEV.to installations.

      # The featured story should be the article that:
      #
      # - has the highest relevance score for the nil_user version
      # - has a main image (see note below).
      #
      # The other articles should use the nil_user version and require
      # the `featured = true` attribute.  In my envisioned
      # implementation, the pagination would omit the featured story.
      #
      # @return [Array<Article, Array<Article>] a featured story
      #         Article and an array of Article objects.
      #
      # @note Per prior work, a featured story is the article that has
      #       a main image, is marked as featured (e.g., featured =
      #       true), and has the highest relevance score.  In the
      #       Articles::Feeds::LargeForemExperimental object we used
      #       the hotness_score to determine which to use.  The
      #       hotness score is most analogue to how this class
      #       calculates the relevance score when we don't have a
      #       user.
      #
      # @note There are requests to allow for the featured article to
      #       NOT require a main image.  We're still talking through
      #       what that means.  This work relates to PR #15333.

      # @note including the ** operator to mirror the method interface
      #       of the other feed strategies.
      #
      # @todo In other implementations, when user's aren't signed in
      #       we favor featured stories.  But not so much that they're
      #       in the featured story.  For non-signed in users, we may
      #       want to use a completely different set of scoring
      #       methods.
      #
      # @note The logic of Articles::Feeds::FindFeaturedStory does not
      #       (at present) filter apply an `Article.featured` scope.
