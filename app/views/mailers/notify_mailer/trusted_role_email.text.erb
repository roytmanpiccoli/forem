Hey <%= @user.name %>!

We are happy to let you know that you've been granted "trusted" status on <%= community_name %>.

This update allows you to make use of a few extra features—all of which further our goal of cultivating a welcoming and constructive community.

Here's an overview of your new abilities:

- Use reactions (👎, 👍) to moderate content
- Quickly flag rule-breaking behavior with 🧐 to <%= community_name %> staff
- Rate the experience level of a post

For details on all available features and how to access them, visit our <%= community_name %> Trusted User Guide: <%= app_url("/community-moderation") %>

<% if ForemInstance.dev_to? %>
  Also, we hope that you'll use this link (https://discord.com/invite/f5ARW5gxES) to join our moderator chat channels on DEV Discord!
  Once inside, visit the #mod-verification channel and drop a link to your DEV profile so we can verify which set of privileges you have (Trusted User [<%= app_url("/community-moderation") %>]
  and/or Tag Moderator [<%= app_url("/tag-moderation") %>]) and invite you to the correct moderator channels. We hope to see you there! 😀
<% end %>

You may occasionally receive notifications about optional moderation actions; please unsubscribe (<%= app_url(user_settings_path(:notifications)) %>) if you do not want to receive these updates.

If you have any questions or feedback for us, please write to <%= ForemInstance.contact_email %> and share your thoughts.

Thanks for being such an awesome member of the community!
