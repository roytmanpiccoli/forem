  # @note [@jeremyf] I am re-implemnenting the initialize method, but removing the Pundit
  #       authorization.  There's an assumption that all policy questions will require a user,
  #       unless you know specifically that they don't.
  #
  # @todo [@jeremyf] I don't like altering the initializer and its core assumption.  But the other
  #       option to get Articles working for https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16529 is to
  #       address the at present fundamental assumption regarding "Policies are for authorizing when
  #       you have a user, otherwise let the controller decide."

  # enough breadcrumbs to undo this short-cut.
