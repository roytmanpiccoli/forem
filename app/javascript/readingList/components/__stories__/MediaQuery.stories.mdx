# Media Queries

[Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) allow us to create responsive experiences by changing the look and feel of a component based on the given media query. This can be done from CSS, but also programmatically via JavaScript. This works well with a component because it **allows us to render only certain markup** based on the evaluated media query unlike a CSS media query which would apply to existing markup.

## Breakpoints

Currently, these are the breakpoints for widths we support out of the box. These can be used to build media queries in your code.

```javascript
export const BREAKPOINTS = Object.freeze({
  Small: '640',
  Medium: '768',
  Large: '1024',
});
```

## useMediaQuery Custom Hook

A custom Preact hook used to evaluate and monitor a given media query.

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from '@components/useMediaQuery';

export function MediaQuery() {
  const matchesBreakpoint = useMediaQuery(`(width >= ${BREAKPOINTS.Medium}px)`);

  if (!matchesBreakpoint) {
    return null;
  }

  return <p>I matched the breakpoint</p>;
}
```

## Media Query Component

The codebase currently has a lot of class based components, so a custom hook cannot be used. the `<MediaQuery />` component is perfect for this scenario. It encapsulates the custom `useMediaQuery` hook allowing us to reuse that logic and expose the result via a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).

```jsx
import { MediaQuery } from '@components/MediaQuery';

<MediaQuery
  query={`(width >= ${BREAKPOINTS.Medium}px)`}
  render={(matches) => {
    return matches && <p>This will render if the media query is matched.</p>;
  }}
/>;
```
