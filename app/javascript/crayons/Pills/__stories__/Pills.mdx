# Pills

Pill is an element representing a relatively short form of data, i.e. short label.
Pill would visually encapsulate such a data in... well, a _pill_.

Generally pills should occur in a herd üê∫. So it's type of data that you would expect to see as set of values.
For example, imagine a list of roles associated with some user's account. 
This could be represented as bunch of pills (of course depending on the context) - each pill being one role.

Pills, expect just representing some data, should also have associated action (e.g. "remove", "edit", ...) but only one per pill.

## Icons

### Description Icon

If possible, this icon should represent the actual data associated with the Pill, 
e.g. if pill's value says "Cake" maybe the icon should also represent a cake.

### Action Icon

If possible, this icon should represent the action associated with the Pill, for example:

- if action associated with a pill is to edit its value, maybe the icon should be a "pen".
- if action associated with a pill is to remove it, maybe the icon should be a "x".

If there is no action associated with a pill (for example when using the prop `noAction`), 
consider not using this icon at all.

#### Destructive Icon

Using actionable pill with an action being designated to remove this specific data was a pretty common scenario.
For that reason, if you need such a pill toggling a prop `destructiveActionIcon` will set "x" icon as default for right icon
and will also apply appropriate styling.

If you need that "destructive" styling but want to use another icon, you can do it too:

```
<Pill
  destructiveActionIcon
  actionIcon={HideIcon}
  ...
>
...
</Pill>
```

## No Action

Pills should usually have an associated action (e.g. "remove", "edit", etc.) but if some rare cases you may want to show one (or more)
of the pills without associated action (for example due to some limitation coming from backend logic, 
like "you can't remove ABC role because you don't have appropriate privileges").

Since Pill is a `<button>` under the hood we actually want to keep it that way. So for these specific and rare occasions please use
`noAction` prop which will apply approriate attributes to the button (`aria-disabled="true"`) - this will keep the Pill
accessible.

It would be wise to provide additional explanation, for example by adding a `tooltip` (read more below).

## Tooltip

By passing a string or node in `tooltip` prop, button will get a custom tooltip (visually different than a classic `title`) on `:hover` and `:focus`.
The tooltip makes up part of the "accessible name" used by assistive technologies like screen readers. 
If you _do not_ wish the tooltip to be part of the accessible name, consider wrapping it in a `<span aria-hidden="true">`.
Tooltips can be temporarily dismissed on `Escape` key press.

```
<Pill
  noAction
  tooltip="Here's why you can't do anything with this Pill..."
  ...
>
```
