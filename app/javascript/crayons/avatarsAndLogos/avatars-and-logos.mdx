## Avatars & Logos

An image representing a user is called an avatar. An image representing a
company or organization is called a logo.

To make a distinction between these two different entities we should keep them
visually different. For Avatars, we gonna use circle shape. And for Logos we
gonna use square shape. This will help recognize what is what in a heartbeat.

Each of these will be available in 5 different sizes (use your best judgment in
picking right size):

- Default: 24px
- L(arge): 32px
- XL(arge): 48px
- 2XL(arge): 64px
- 3XL(arge): 128px

Remember to use descriptive alt=&quot;&quot; values!
