## Notices

Use Notices to focus user on specific piece of content, for example (but not
limited to):

- alerts after form submission,
- box with tip like “Did you know..?”
- etc...

This should be simple message. And this is exactly what this Figma component let
you do.

By default, this component has 16px padding.
