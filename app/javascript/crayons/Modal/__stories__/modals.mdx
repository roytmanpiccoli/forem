# Modals

Modals should be positioned centered in relation to entire viewport. So relation
to its trigger doesn't really matter.

Use your best judgements when choosing the right size.

## Sizes

We have 3 possible sizes to use:

- Small - 480px - for displaying small amount of data/text.
- Medium - 640px (this is default one) - you will probably want to use this one in most cases.
- Large - 768px - use for long and/or complex contnet.

## Prompts

Except classic Modals you can also use `prompt` style (prop) to apply _special styling_. 
It will work best with really short messages or some sort of confirmation prompts, for example:

> Are you sure you want to remove Ben's account? 
>
> [YES] [NO]

The "special styling" means it will:

- always use Small (480px) size,
- remove the divider between title and content so it all looks more like a one message.

### Centered prompt

Some prompts may visually benefit from centering the content. 
Leave the decision to designers but keep it mind this is possible with `centered` prop
(and it will only work in combination with `prompt`).

## Backdrop

By default Modals come with dark backdrop (a layer overlaying underlaying content). 
It is possible to not show it but it should be used in some very rare scenarios, when underlaying
content might still be important as additional context.

Because of having that backdrop is a "good default", you should use `noBackdrop` prop cerfaully,
ideally after consulting with your desinger.

## Modal accessibility

The Preact Modal component utilises the `focus-trap` library to ensure that:

- When the modal is opened, focus is transferred to the first interactive item
  in that modal
- When the modal is closed, focus is transferred back to the button that
  activated the modal
- While the modal is open, focus is trapped inside so that when a user presses
  the Tab key, interactive items behind the modal are not focused
- When the modal is open, pressing the Escape key will close it
