# Color Picker

The Color Picker component provides two mechanisms to select a color:

- A text input field
- A pop-up color selector

When a valid color is selected in one, it is updated in the other. If a user inputs an invalid hex code to the text field, it is ignored, and the last valid color continues to serve as the value of both fields.

The core functionality and accessibility comes from the [`react-colorful` package](https://github.com/omgovich/react-colorful).
