## Mention autocomplete

The `MentionAutocompleteTextArea` component uses the
[Reach UI Combobox](https://reach.tech/combobox/) under the hood. It works by
_replacing_ the textarea you pass in props with one enhanced with the `@mention`
functionality.

The autocomplete will begin fetching suggestions once a user has typed `@` plus
at least two characters. A user&apos;s selection is confirmed when they either:

- Click on a search option
- Hit enter on a search option
- Click away from the dropdown
- Enter space to move away from the autocomplete

### Mention autocomplete accessibility

The component replaces the given textarea with one generated using
[Reach UI Combobox](https://reach.tech/combobox/). The underlying behavior then
conforms to the
[WAI_ARIA guidelines on comboboxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#combobox).

An `aria-live` region communicates to a screen reader user when the list has
been populated with suggestions.

Please note: When using the `MentionAutocompleteTextArea`, you must have either
an `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attribute on the textarea you pass as a
prop. These attributes are copied across to the Reach UI Combobox input,
ensuring it is labelled correctly for accessibility.
