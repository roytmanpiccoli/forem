## Buttons

Use Danger style only for destructive actions like removing something. Do not
use it for, for example “unfollow” action.

If you have to use several buttons together, keep in mind you should always have
ONE Primary button. Rest of them should be Secondary and/or Outlined and/or Text
buttons.

It is ok to use ONLY Secondary or outlined button without being accompanied by
Primary one.

For Stacking buttons (vertically or horizontally) please use 8px spacing unit
for default size buttons (no matter if stacking horizontally or vertically).
