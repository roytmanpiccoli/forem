# Utility-First CSS

Utility-First CSS makes it easier for developers to rapidly build and prototype
front-end designs without touching actual CSS too much (or at all!).

Imagine you have to create a container that has background color, border radius
etc. Normally, you would write a piece of HTML and then create SCSS file for
that and define all the styles. With Utility-First Classes/ the intention is to
skip writing CSS. Instead you write only HTML that contains several class names,
like this:

```
<div class="radius-default bg-accent-brand p-6 mb-4">Hello world!</div>
```

This element has several classes applied. Each responsible for different part of
styling:

|**Utility Class**|True CSS|
|---|---|
|**`radius-default`**|`border-radius: 5px;`|
|**`bg-accent-brand`**|`background-color: #3b49df;`|
|**`p-6`**|`padding: 24px;`|
|**`mb-4`**|`margin-bottom: 16px;`|

Wait, how does `p-6` equate to `24px`? Under the hood, we use lots of
variables like this:

--su-1: 4px; // `su` stands for _spacing unit_ --su-2: 8px; --su-3: 12px; ...
--su-6: 24px; // that's our example: p-6 is literally `padding: var(--su-6);`
...

(btw. we have much more variables)

In other words, our Utility-First Classes/ take into consideration all the UI
patterns and guidelines we have established for Forem (font sizes, colors,
spacing units, etc.) and thanks to this Forem provides more consistent UI.
