# Introduction to Crayons üñç

Crayons is the design system of Forem. Defining our design language and
front-end approach, Crayons provides you everything you need to quickly design,
build, and ship coherent experience and style across Forem.

Crayons consists of libraries of:

- **Components** to create reusable features and views, such as buttons, form
  elements, tabs, and more.

- **Utility-first CSS classes** to let developers write front-end code almost
  without touching a single CSS file.

---

### **How can I use Crayons?**

There are a few scenarios how you can incorporate Crayons into your workflow.
Depending on the scenario, you'll build the front-end using components,
utility-first CSS classes, or both.

#### 1. I want to use existing components.

A designer hands you a mockup featuring UI components that already exist. You
can find the documented component here, copy and paste the code that renders the
specific component, and call it a day.

#### 2. I want to use an existing component, but customize it a bit.

A designer hands you a mockup featuring existing UI components with a small
change to them; the padding is slightly different, the background color is
different. There are two things you can do in this scenario:

1. Implement the existing `component` and customize it with _utility-first
   classes_. It makes sense if you need to make small changes like increase
   padding, make border thicker etc...

2. Consider extending existing `component` to support your case. This is more
   time-consuming solution because you should make sure it's context-agnostic -
   so it should work in any context, not only for your feature.

#### 3. I want to implement a view, but no existing components exist to help me build it.

If this is the case, you will have to build everything from scratch. There are
two ways you can do this:

1. Build the view using `utility-first CSS classes`. This lets you avoid having
   to create or work in any existing CSS files, and you can do anything from
   applying simple padding styles to styling entire views.

2. Build some of the view using both `utility-first CSS classes` and existing
   `components. This will allow you to move more quickly.

#### 4. I want to an entire view from scratch (whoa!).

Think you have to write tons of custom CSS and import your .scss file somewhere?
Think again.

As mentioned earlier, `utility-first CSS classes` let you create even the most
complex components without writing a single line of CSS. **We recommend choosing
to write code using utility-first CSS over creating a new SCSS each time.**
Every additional line of CSS you write translates to more CSS that we have to
maintain, more CSS for our users to download, and more bytes for us to host.
